# Overview

For this project, I wanted my computer to be able to use networking in an interesting way that we all use daily. I thought of creating an email maker/sender that could create emails and send them to a spam email account. I thought it would be super interesting so that I could understand bots a little bit better and also do some networking within Python, as I haven't done anything like this in this language before.

# Network Communication

I acutally chose to do clinet/server because of the idea that I thought up. This program could be used to send emails through Yahoo, or even Gmail too! In this format, the client is sending information to the server. This format is also using TCP (email) because it requires all the information in the right spot (based on Python libraries).

# Development Environment

For this project, I used Python. I also used a couple of libraries, including the follwoing:

smtplib
encoders
MIMEText
MIMEBase
MIMEMultipart

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I would like to make my own website and link it to the program.
* I would like to recieve emails from another email rather than just sending it.
